2) Rossmann_Retail_Sales_prediction â€“ EDA with Regression project 
Objective :
Developed a model to predict daily sales for Rossmann drugstores across Europe, enabling store managers to forecast sales up to six weeks in advance.                                                                                                                 Key Tasks:                                                                                                                                                     Conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the impact of factors like promotions, competition, holidays, seasonality, and locality on sales.                                                                                                           Preprocessed historical sales data for 1,115 Rossmann stores, considering stores that were temporarily closed for refurbishment.                                                                                                                                                Built regression models to accurately forecast sales, incorporating multiple variables that influence store performance.                                                                                                                                              Business Impact:                                                                                                                                    Improved the accuracy of sales predictions, providing store managers with data-driven insights to make informed decisions.											       Enhanced operational efficiency by predicting demand and optimizing inventory management based on the forecasted sales.                                                                                                                                               Tools & Techniques:											           Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn)                                                                                                           Data Visualization (Matplotlib, Seaborn)                                                                                                 Regression Modeling (Linear Regression(with ridge,lasso and ElasticNet Regularization with GridsearchCV method), Decision tree , etc.
